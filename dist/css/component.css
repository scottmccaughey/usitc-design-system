/*
  Breakpoints mixin

  @include breakpoint($point)

  The breakpoint() function takes a single required parameter. You must pass in the breakpoint
  name or a number ($point). If a breakpoint name is passed, the $breakpoints list as
  defined in _settings.scss (@section 3) is used for a mininum-width. If a number is passed,
  that number of pixels is used as a minimum-width.

  Ithis will cause any styles between the {} brackets to be applied only to
  screen sizes wider than the breakpoint passed:

  @include breakpoint(m) {
    font-size: 18px;
  }

  ...will set the font-size to '18px' on any screen larger than the medium breakpoint size.

  @include breakpoint(1024) {
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  ...will set the font-weight to 'bold' on any screen larger than 1024 pixels wide.

/*
  String Replacement function

  str-replace($string, $search, $replace)

  The str-replace() function takes three parameters, the first two of which are required. You
  must pass the text to be modified ($string) and the text you want to replace ($search). The
  third (optional) parameter is the text you want to insert in place of the $search text
  ($replace). If the $replace parameter is not passed, the $search text will simply be
  removed. For example:

  .selector {
    $string: 'The answer to life, the universe and everything is blah.';
    content: str-replace($string, 'blah', '42');
  }

  ...will compile to the following CSS...

  .selector {
    content: 'The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42.';
  }

  This function is used in the Font Face Declaration mixin defined and documented in
  _directives.scss (@section 6).

/*
  Font Face Declaration mixin

  fontdef($family, $type, $weight, $style, $stretch)

  Uses the $font-families list as defined in _settings.scss (@section 5a).

  The fontdef() mixin takes five parameters, the first two of which are required. You must pass
  the font family name ($family) and font variant name ($variant) to generate a @font-face
  definition.

  You can also pass an optional $weight [normal | 100 | 200 | ... | 800 | 900], $style
  [normal | italic], and $stretch [normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed |
  semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded]. The optional
  variables will all default to 'normal' if they are not passed. The $stretch variable is
  currently not used in our design system, but is available for potential future use.

  For example:

  @include font-def(Fira Sans Condensed, semibolditalic, 600, italic, normal);

  ...will compile to the following CSS...

  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Fira Sans Condensed';
    src: url('../fonts/firasanscondensed-semibolditalic.woff') format('woff');
    font-weight: 600;
    font-style: italic;
    font-stretch: normal;
  }

  This function is used to generate @font-face declarations in _fonts.scss.
