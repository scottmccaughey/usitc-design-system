/*
  Breakpoints mixin

  @include breakpoint($point)

  The breakpoint() function takes a single required parameter. You must pass in the breakpoint
  name or a number ($point). If a breakpoint name is passed, the $breakpoints list as
  defined in _settings.scss (@section 3) is used for a mininum-width. If a number is passed,
  that number of pixels is used as a minimum-width.

  Ithis will cause any styles between the {} brackets to be applied only to
  screen sizes wider than the breakpoint passed:

  @include breakpoint(m) {
    font-size: 18px;
  }

  ...will set the font-size to '18px' on any screen larger than the medium breakpoint size.

  @include breakpoint(1024) {
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  ...will set the font-weight to 'bold' on any screen larger than 1024 pixels wide.

  @if type-of($point) != number {
    @each $name, $width in $breakpoints {
